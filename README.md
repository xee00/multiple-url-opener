# Minimalistic Multi URL Opener

License: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3

URL: https://xee00.github.io/multiple-url-opener/

This project was created primarily to gain first experience with ReactJS. It is available via Github Pages and can be used by everyone. It is completely open source and ad-free. There is only a Google Analytics link built in, which allows me to monitor the usage. 

Everyone is free to request features or implement them themselves.

Features so far:
- Automatically add https:// if not specified
- Color highlighting of correct URLs
- Optional time delay between opening URLs
